GNOME Internet Radio Locator is Free Software for
locating and listening to radio broadcasts on the
Internet.

Most of the included radio stations broadcast are
existing AM/FM broadcasters that provide Internet
streaming.

You can listen to these Internet radio broadcasts
like AM/FM, but GNOME Internet Radio Locator lets
you receive broadcasts over Internet unlike AM/FM
receivers from broadcasters anywhere in the world.
